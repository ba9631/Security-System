# Security System

## Overview
This C++ program implements a basic security system with features like user registration, login, and password change. Users interact with the system through a console-based interface. The program uses file handling to store user information, including usernames and passwords.

## Features <a name="features"></a>
- **User Registration:** Allows users to register by providing a username, password, and age.
- **Login:** Users can log in with their registered username and password.
- **Password Change:** Provides the option to change the password after verifying the old password.
- **File Handling:** Utilizes file I/O to store and retrieve user information.

## Usage <a name="usage"></a>
1. **Compile the Code:**
   ```bash
   g++ security_system.cpp -o security_system
2. **Run the Program:**
    ```bash
    ./security_system
3. **Follow On-screen Instructions:**
   - Choose options based on the desired action (registration, login, password change, or program termination).
   - Enter the required information as prompted.
     
## Code Structure <a name="code-structure"></a>
The program consists of a single C++ source file (security_system.cpp) with the following key components:

- User Interface: Displays a menu with options for registration, login, password change, and program termination.
- Switch Case: Uses a switch statement to handle user choices and execute corresponding actions.
- File Handling: Manages user data using file I/O operations for registration, login, and password change.

## Improvements <a name="improvements"></a>

- Code Readability: Add more comments to explain the purpose of each section and improve code readability.
- Error Handling: Implement better error handling for cases such as file not found, incorrect input, etc.
- Password Security: Consider implementing password hashing for improved security.
- Input Validation: Validate user input to prevent unexpected behavior, especially when entering non-numeric values.

## Security Considerations <a name="security-considerations"></a>
- Password Storage: In a real-world scenario, storing passwords in plaintext is not recommended. Implement password hashing for better security.
- File Access Control: Ensure proper file permissions to restrict unauthorized access to user data.
